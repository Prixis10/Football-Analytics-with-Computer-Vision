# ⚽ Football Analytics with Computer Vision

Welcome to the **Football Analytics** project! This project leverages computer vision techniques to analyze football games. By using YOLO for object detection, KMeans for player segmentation, Optical Flow for camera movement, and perspective transformation for distance measurement, this system provides accurate speed and distance calculations for improved performance analysis.

## 📖 Overview

This project uses the following tech stack:
- 🧠 **YOLO**: For object detection and tracking.
- 🎨 **KMeans**: For player segmentation.
- 📹 **Optical Flow**: For camera movement detection.
- 🖼️ **OpenCV**: For computer vision tasks.
- 🐍 **Python**: As the programming language.
- 🤖 **TensorFlow**: For deep learning tasks.

## ✨ Features

- **Object Detection and Tracking**: Using YOLO to detect and track players and the ball.
- **Player Segmentation**: Using KMeans to segment players from the background.
- **Camera Movement**: Using Optical Flow to detect camera movement.
- **Distance Measurement**: Using perspective transformation to measure distances accurately.
